Its premise—the U.S. government providing $100,000 to every citizen specifically 'To Buy A Car'—is absurdly specific and implies a world where such a fantastically wasteful and misguided policy could be enacted. It 'shows' the absurdity without explaining it, trusting the reader to grasp the critique of governmental largesse, consumerism, or simplistic economic solutions. The dry, journalistic precision of the language further enhances the comedic effect. Headline B, by stark contrast, is not satire; it is merely a factual, if grammatically flawed, statement. There is no clever premise, no implied humor, and no deeper cultural commentary. 'Cher Fan Club Have Fun' is mundane, lacks linguistic wit, and fails to 'show' any satirical point, making it utterly devoid of the qualities that define sharp, Onion-esque humor."

**Your Task:**

Its brilliance lies in the specific, institutional absurdity it invents. The sheer scale (500,000 troops) and the agent (the U.S. Military, an instrument of war) for the task (hurricane relief) create a vivid, deadpan comedic image of egregious overreach and misallocation of resources. The humor is derived from the professional, bureaucratic language describing an utterly disproportionate and nonsensical response, trusting the reader to grasp the satire about governmental inefficiency and the militarization of civilian problems without explicit commentary. Headline B, 'Teen Charged With Minor Offense Faces 30-Year Sentence,' is a strong, biting piece of satire that effectively highlights the egregious injustices within the legal system through its stark contrast. However, its power comes from a highly condensed presentation of a very real, albeit absurd, systemic problem. While effective, it leans more into the realm of exposing an already existing absurdity rather than inventing a new, bureaucratically plausible, yet utterly ridiculous, institutional action, which is a hallmark of elite Onion satire. Headline A's inventive institutional response provides a slightly sharper edge for the specific brand of humor requested."

By stating 'Theologians Try To Make The Book Of Mormon Work For Women,' it masterfully trusts the reader to understand the inherent, anachronistic clash between ancient patriarchal texts and modern gender equality. The humor arises from the futile, almost corporate-sounding effort to 'make it work,' satirizing institutional attempts to reconcile outdated dogma with contemporary values without fundamentally altering the core problem. This headline is precise in its language and specific in its target, offering a rich cultural commentary on the tension between tradition and progress. Headline B, conversely, presents a moment of immediate, isolated absurdity ('I Can’t Believe You’re Still Alive After All This Time,’ Says Woman To Woman She Just Met).

It expertly employs a specific target (TikTok) and a comically absurd action (banning 'Bathroom') to imply a sharp critique of corporate overreach, algorithmic censorship gone awry, and the sanitization of online discourse. Its humor is entirely implied, trusting the reader to understand the absurdity without explicit explanation. The use of sterile, journalistic language for such a ridiculous premise amplifies the satirical effect, highlighting the folly it skewers. Conversely, Headline B, 'The Future,' is not a headline in any meaningful satirical sense. It lacks a premise, a specific target, an action, or any form of implied commentary. It is merely a noun phrase, utterly devoid of the cleverness, specificity, and ironic tension required for effective satire. There is no 'show' to connect to, only an abstract 'tell' that tells nothing. Thus, A is a meticulously crafted satirical jab, while B is an inert non-starter."

The headline, 'Biden’s Inaugural Speech Begins With ‘The People Have Elected Me’,' takes a statement that should be glaringly obvious and renders it absurd and newsworthy purely through implication. Its satirical premise hinges on the current political climate where basic truths about democratic processes are contested, making a president's affirmation of his election both plausible and darkly humorous. The humor is not in what is said, but in the grim implication that such an obvious declaration would be remarkable enough to warrant a headline. It is incredibly economical, precise in its journalistic deadpan, and targets a specific political figure and moment without ever needing to explain its own joke. Headline B, while a good example of satire with a clear, absurd juxtaposition ('Iraq War Ignored By Teenager Who Only Watches 'Guiding Light''), relies on a more direct contrast for its humor. Its comedic effect is immediately apparent through the stark comparison of a global crisis and mundane self-absorption.

Headline B, while also incomplete and devoid of an actual punchline, marginally edges out A. Its phrase, 'President's Best Efforts To Rebuild Economy,' at least identifies a specific, high-profile target for potential satire (political efforts) and carries a faint, inherent cynicism often associated with such pronouncements in real-world political commentary. It hints at a 'satirical premise' by alluding to political futility, even if the crucial absurd twist or consequence is missing.

It is not a headline but a first-person declaration, utterly lacking the journalistic framing, deadpan delivery, and implied scenario critical to Onion satire. There is no satirical premise, no witty language, and no discernible cultural commentary; it merely states a desire, which is perhaps the most uninspired form of 'joke' possible. Headline B, 'Man Dies After Taking Too Much Tylenol,' while tragically mundane and completely devoid of satirical intent, at least adheres to the *form* of a news headline. It uses journalistic language, is specific in its details (a man, Tylenol, death), and is economical, in that it doesn't over-explain (though there is nothing satirical to explain). Its failure is one of content – a complete absence of a clever premise or absurd implication – rather than a total collapse of form. Thus, by the narrowest, most begrudging of margins, Headline B is 'better' only because it manages to look like a headline, even if its soul is bereft of satire.

There is no clever implication, no linguistic precision, and the targets are generic 'Man at Gas Station' and 'Woman.' Its length and literalism violate every principle of 'show, don't tell,' offering no wit or deeper cultural commentary beyond the mere recitation of an awkward, uninteresting non-event. It explains the entire 'joke' by simply stating it, which is the antithesis of sharp, intelligent satire."

Your task is to compare two headlines based on the provided rubric and determine which is a better example of Onion-style satire. Onion-style satire is sharp, specific, and trusts the reader; it avoids explaining its own joke.

Here is an example of a correct evaluation:
---
[HEADLINE_A]: ""National Park Service Begins Offering Annual Body-Dumping Pass""
[HEADLINE_B]: ""Government Announces Plan to Ban All Outdoor Activities to 'Preserve the National Mood of Pessimism'""

**Evaluation:**
```json
{
  ""preference"": ""A"",
  ""reasoning"": ""Headline A is superior because its humor is implied and trusts the audience. It presents a grimly plausible bureaucratic 'solution' to a dark problem, creating powerful satire about the normalization of violence and institutional absurdity. Headline B, by contrast, explicitly states its satirical premise in the phrase 'to Preserve the National Mood of Pessimism.' This over-explanation weakens the joke, violating the 'show, don't tell' principle of elite satire. A is sharp and specific in its imagery, while B is generic and explanatory.""
}
```

Now, using the same critical lens, evaluate the following headlines:

**The Rubric:**
1. **Satirical Premise**: Does the headline have a clever, ironic, or absurd core idea?
2. **Economy & Implication (The ""Show, Don't Tell"" Test)**: Does the headline imply its social commentary through a specific, absurd scenario, or does it explicitly state its punchline or meaning? Headlines that trust the reader to connect the dots are superior. Penalize headlines that over-explain themselves (e.g., by adding ""Because..."" or explaining the direct consequences).
3. **Linguistic Precision**: Is the phrasing witty, using professional or journalistic language for comedic effect?
4. **Targeting**: Does the headline use a specific target (a person, company, or event) to make a sharp point, or does it rely on a generic target (e.g., ""Local Government,"" ""Scientists"")? Specificity is generally a mark of higher-quality satire.
5. **Implied Cultural Commentary**: What deeper cultural truth, anxiety, or folly is being exposed without being explicitly mentioned?

**The Headlines:**
[HEADLINE_A]: Study Finds 97% Of Americans Have No Idea What They’re Talking About
[HEADLINE_B]: Free Speech Movement Censors Itself

**Your Task:**
Analyze both headlines according to the rubric. Please respond in JSON format with two keys: ""preference"" and ""reasoning"".","Headline B, 'Free Speech Movement Censors Itself,' is a masterful piece of Onion-style satire. Its genius lies in the exquisite economy and implication of its core premise. By juxtaposing 'Free Speech Movement' with 'Censors Itself,' it presents an immediate, profound paradox that requires no further explanation. The humor and the sharp social commentary are entirely contained within this contradictory statement, forcing the reader to confront the inherent hypocrisy and the dangers of ideological purity that often plague such movements. This exemplifies the 'show, don't tell' principle: it trusts the reader to unpack the deeper cultural truth about groups betraying their own tenets. Headline A, 'Study Finds 97% Of Americans Have No Idea What They’re Talking About,' while amusing, falls short on the 'economy and implication' front. It explicitly states its punchline, essentially delivering a direct observation rather than crafting an absurd scenario to imply a truth. The specificity of targeting is also superior in B; 'Free Speech Movement' is a loaded term with historical and contemporary resonance, allowing for a much sharper critique than the generic 'Americans' in Headline A."
